Mastercraft Lighting is database software that connects the CAD drawings of a light plot to the people who install and maintain live events.  Designed specifically to meet the needs of lighting designers and technicians in the entertainment industry, it allows the data in the lighting plot to be viewed in several formats to facilitate the installation of the system and the programming of the show.  The app was built in 7 days using Rails, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery UI, HTML5, and CSS3.
